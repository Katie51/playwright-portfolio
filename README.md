# Playwright Portfolio Project

This project showcases my hands-on experience building a robust test automation framework using **Playwright** with **TypeScript**. It covers both **UI** and **API** testing for a sample e-commerce-style application and demonstrates my ability to structure tests in a scalable, maintainable way using best practices.

---

- **Playwright** (TypeScript)
- **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern
- **Faker library** â€“ for generating dynamic test data
- **dotenv** â€“ for securely managing environment variables

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

The project is organized into main and two key branches, each representing a different area of automation focus:

###  `main`
- âœ… **Automated Login, Account Creation, and Checkout UI**
- Implements full UI flow: login, registration, adding items to cart, and completing a purchase
- Uses Page Object Model and dynamic test data with Faker

###  `branch1`
- âœ… **Automated Login & User Account CRUD API**
- Covers authentication and user management via direct API testing
- All requests and data validations handled using Playwrightâ€™s request context
- Credentials managed with `.env`

###  `branch2`
- âœ… **Utilized API to support UI tests**
- Demonstrates hybrid testing by using API in UI test
